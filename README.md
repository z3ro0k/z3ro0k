### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi my name is Alexis, but known as Atzu or z3ro0k over the internet and I am a 19 year old "fullstack" developer that spends time coding and building websites. 
I've been coding for around 4 years now and still on the road to learn more.

## Fun Facts
- I know the following languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Kotlin, Java, and Python
- I plan to learn in the near future: Rust, Go, C++, and Dart
- I work on too many stuff and never get them finished
- You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MrAzurnex), on my [Discord](https://discord.gg/q99CQEP) server, or on [My Website](https://atzu.xyz)
